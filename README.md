### Notato

A (very) simple CRUD webapp for managing small personal text notes.
Based on [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), [Shelve database](http://docs.python.org/library/shelve.html) and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
Mostly something I wrote to teach myself Flask.
